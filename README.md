# ZMK Config for 3x5\_2

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evantravers/zmk-config/master/keymap-drawer/corneish_zen.svg)

- Mainly for my [Corne-ish Zen](https://evantravers.com/articles/2022/04/19/review-corne-ish-zen/), hopefully going to be for a [Cygnus](https://github.com/juhakaup/keyboards/tree/main/Cygnus%20v1.0) soonâ€¦
- I have successfully moved to mostly using a `3x5_2` layout like a Ferris Sweep.
- This layout is more or less mirrored on my [QMK firmware userspace](https://github.com/evantravers/qmk_userspace) from a layout developed on my [QMK firmware fork](https://github.com/evantravers/qmk_firmware).

## Quick Note on Thumb Position Strategy:

- I prefer to rest my thumbs neutrally just outside (roughly 1u) outside my homerow pointer fingers. (Primary thumb, anchor position)
- The secondary thumb key is outside that anchor position, where I curl my thumb towards my palm to reach it.
- Compressed layouts like the Bancounver40 are more usable, and the overall footprint of the keyboard is smaller.
- We'll see about the long-term ergos of this, it's new to me.
